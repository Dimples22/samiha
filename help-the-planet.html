  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Climate Clock is ticking. Every choice matters, and one area where we can act immediately is plastic pollution, which harms oceans, soil, and wildlife while contributing to climate change.</p>

  <h2>New Alternatives to Plastic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vivomer</strong> - a biodegradable, plant-based material from Shellworks. It can be shaped like plastic and composts naturally. Already used in beauty and cosmetic packaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Mycelium packaging</strong> - made from mushroom roots, fully compostable, used for shipping and protective packaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Notpla</strong> - made from seaweed, used for films, sachets, and disposable packaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Mango Materials</strong> - turns methane gas into biodegradable polymers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These materials reduce the need for fossil-fuel plastics and help prevent long-term pollution.</p>

  <h2>How You Can Make a Difference</h2>
  <h3>Support products using sustainable materials</h3>
  <p>Buy from brands using Vivomer, mycelium, or other biodegradable packaging. Every purchase signals demand for sustainable alternatives.</p>

  <h3>Advocate to businesses</h3>
  <p>Suggest alternatives like Vivomer, Notpla, or mycelium to local or global companies. Small recommendations can influence supply chains and encourage widespread adoption.</p>

  <h3>Sign petitions and push for policy change</h3>
  <p>Support petitions targeting governments or regulators to ban harmful single-use plastics or require eco-friendly materials. Target decision-makers like the UK government, EU Commission, or local councils.</p>

  <h3>Reduce personal plastic use</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use reusable bottles, bags, and containers.</li>
    <li>Avoid excessive packaging and single-use items.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spread awareness</h3>
  <p>Switching to alternative materials alone will not solve climate change, but every action counts. One purchase, one recommendation, or one message at a time can make a difference!</p>
