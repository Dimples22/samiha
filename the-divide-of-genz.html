    <h1>The Divide of Gen Z</h1>
    <p class="article-meta">Published Jul 27, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gen Z is coming of age during a time of fast technological change, shifting social values, and increasing instability.
      This has led to deep divisions within the generation, especially when it comes to politics, gender equality, and romantic relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      These divisions are shaped by a mix of online radicalisation, differing views on feminism, and the impact of economic and mental health stress.
      To understand what’s going on, it’s important to look closely at the influences behind these shifts.
    </p>

    <h2>Political Polarisation</h2>
    <p>Political division is one of the clearest signs of fragmentation within Gen Z.</p>
    <p>
      Young women are increasingly liberal, while young men are leaning more conservative.
      Election data from multiple countries shows a consistent trend: women aged 18–29 are moving left,
      while a growing number of young men are aligning with the right, sometimes the far-right.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gap has grown with the rise of online communities like the “manosphere,” which promote anti-feminist, racist,
      and misogynistic ideologies. These spaces are no longer fringe. They’re highly visible on platforms like TikTok and X,
      where influencers speak directly to young men who feel overlooked or excluded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Algorithms reward controversy. Even when young men search for advice on dating or self-improvement,
      the content they see often shifts toward more extreme views. Red pill content becomes part of the feed.
      At the same time, some women are drawn to “tradwife” content that promotes traditional gender roles
      and questions feminist values in subtle ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gender divide in political values isn’t entirely new. Women have historically leaned left.
      But what’s new is the intensity of the divide and the role of social media in making it more visible and more extreme.
    </p>

    <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
    <p>This political gap is closely tied to how Gen Z views gender equality.</p>
    <p>The difference in opinions between Gen Z men and women is larger than in any previous generation.</p>
    <p>Only 32% of Gen Z men identify as feminists, compared to 53% of Gen Z women.</p>
    <p>28% of Gen Z men believe a man who stays home with children is “less of a man,” compared to 19% of women.</p>
    <p>60% of Gen Z men say men are being expected to do too much to support equality; only 38% of women agree.</p>
    <p>57% of Gen Z men think promoting women’s rights has gone so far that it now discriminates against men, compared to 36% of women.</p>

    <p>
      This is not just a disagreement on values; it’s a structural split in worldview.
    </p>

    <p>
      A major influence here is “red pill” ideology. It argues that men and women are fundamentally different
      and that feminism is harmful. Red pill spaces often reduce women to stereotypes, claiming they only seek
      high-status partners and are biologically less rational or capable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reports from ex-partners of red pill-influenced men reveal harmful patterns such as disbelief when a woman
      shows intelligence or ambition or strict expectations that women take on caregiving roles.
    </p>

    <h2>Dating and Relationships</h2>
    <p>The political and ideological splits within Gen Z carry over into dating culture.</p>
    <p>
      Many Gen Z individuals are stepping away from traditional relationships.
      One pattern is the rise of a “nonchalant” dating style, where people try to connect without showing effort or emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of relationships, many fall into situationships, casual hookups, or endless talking stages.
      The idea of “attracting, not chasing” reinforces emotional distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another trend is “heteropessimism,” a growing sense of disillusionment with heterosexual relationships.
      Many women feel burdened by unequal emotional labour or frustrated by repeated bad experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response, some embrace movements like South Korea’s “4B,” where young women reject dating, marriage,
      and even sex with men. Others go “boy sober” or choose celibacy, citing concerns about harassment or lack of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, red pill content encourages manipulation. Tactics like emotional detachment,
      using scripts to gain sexual access, or creating fear of abandonment are common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research connects these behaviours to narcissism and psychopathy.
      Former partners report feeling controlled, gaslighted, and cut off from their support networks.
    </p>

    <h2>Root Causes</h2>
    <p>
      These issues don’t exist in a vacuum. They are tied to broader structural problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Financial insecurity makes it harder to build and maintain relationships.
      Romantic gestures, dates, and even private time together often require resources that many Gen Z individuals don’t have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental health is another key factor. Anxiety, depression, and burnout are common.
      Many young people feel overwhelmed by crises like the climate emergency, job instability, or global conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social media reinforces these patterns. Algorithms push extreme content and encourage echo chambers.
      This normalises toxic behaviour, fuels distrust between genders, and makes it easier to avoid real vulnerability.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Gen Z is not a unified generation. It’s one deeply divided along lines of gender, politics, and social values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding these dynamics is important.
      The generation is not inherently hostile or broken—it’s reacting to a complex set of challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing these divisions requires pushing back against harmful ideologies
      and creating space for honest conversations about respect, vulnerability, and equality.
    </p>
