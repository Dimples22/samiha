    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>It’s hard to sum up who I am in one paragraph. My book is about my life and what has made me who I am, yet I am someone who is constantly evolving, constantly experiencing. I wrote The Simulacrum because it felt like a long time coming. Writing is the one way I can take the time to articulate my thoughts, and this book is everything I’ve been keeping inside.</p>
    <p>I believed that if no one could understand me, then maybe this could help them. Most people will never know what it is like to have a complicated childhood that seeps into the smallest parts of your day-to-day life. They might never stop to think that perhaps the little girl who was mute in school was mute for a reason. I hope my book can offer comfort to those who understand these feelings and awareness to those who may not so they might see a little more, think a little deeper, and be a little more mindful.</p>

        <h3>The Simulacrum</h3>
        <p>Blending fiction with lived experience, The Simulacrum belongs to the genre of autofiction, a form that blurs the boundaries between autobiography and imagination. Rather than following a traditional plot, it turns inward, tracing the protagonist’s inner world: her disintegration, her tentative reconstruction, and her philosophical reckonings with selfhood, love, and loss. Episodic, confessional, and deeply introspective, this book is a work that lingers on questions rather than answers; it is an invitation for readers to step into another consciousness and perhaps find parallels in their own.</p>
