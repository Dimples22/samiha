        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          It’s hard to sum up who I am in one paragraph. My book is about my life and what has made me who I am, yet I am someone who is constantly evolving, constantly experiencing. I wrote The Simulacrum because it felt like a long time coming. Writing is the one way I can take the time to articulate my thoughts, and this book is everything I’ve been keeping inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believed that if no one could understand me, then maybe this could help them. Most people will never know what it is like to have a complicated childhood that seeps into the smallest parts of your day-to-day life. They might never stop to think that perhaps the little girl who was mute in school was mute for a reason. I hope my book can offer comfort to those who understand these feelings and awareness to those who may not so they might see a little more, think a little deeper, and be a little more mindful.

        <h2>Why Work With Me</h2>
        <p>
          I put in the work instead of taking the easy way because I trust myself and know I can do better. I am almost a jack of all trades, interested in writing, drawing, coding, leading, content creation, designing, and more, and I am adaptable and learn fast. I am more passionate than most, and when I want to do something, I do it instead of procrastinating. I am independent and use my free time to grow my skills and knowledge, always pushing myself to improve and take on new challenges.

          <h3>The Simulacrum</h3>
          <p>
            Blending fiction with lived experience, The Simulacrum belongs to the genre of autofiction, a form that blurs the boundaries between autobiography and imagination. Rather than following a traditional plot, it turns inward, tracing the protagonist’s inner world: her disintegration, her tentative reconstruction, and her philosophical reckonings with selfhood, love, and loss. Episodic, confessional, and deeply introspective, this book lingers on questions rather than answers.
